# aDeal Network - Project Summary

## Overview

aDeal Network is a decentralized advertising platform built on Optimism L2 that revolutionizes digital advertising by putting users in control of their data and rewarding them for viewing relevant advertisements.

## Problem Statement

Traditional digital advertising suffers from several critical issues:

1. **Privacy Violations**: Users' personal data is collected and sold without consent
2. **Poor User Experience**: Irrelevant ads create frustration and ad fatigue
