- Validate wallet signatures
- Implement rate limiting
- Regular security audits

### Performance
- Use caching strategies (Redis)
- Implement database indexing
- Optimize smart contract gas usage
- Use CDN for static assets
- Monitor performance metrics

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for user flows
- Smart contract testing with Hardhat
- Performance testing with load testing tools

## Deployment Strategy

- Production: Optimism mainnet

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated testing on pull requests
- Automated deployment to staging
- Manual approval for production
- Automated rollback on failures

### Infrastructure
- Containerized deployment with Docker
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Cloud-native architecture
- Multi-region deployment

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- 99.9% uptime
